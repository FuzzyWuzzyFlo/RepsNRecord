# RepsNRecord
RepsNRecord is a lightweight fitness logging application designed to help users consistently track their workouts. Unlike bulky fitness platforms, FitLog focuses on simplicity by allowing users to record exercises, weights, sets, and notes in a clean, journal-like interface.

The application leverages modern web technologies and freely available services to ensure accessibility and ease of use. Progress can be reviewed over time, and users may opt in to receive reminders or updates through email, SMS, or chat applications (e.g., Discord, Slack).
